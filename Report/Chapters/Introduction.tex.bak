\chapter{Introduction}

Programming has always been an activity which is done on a computer with a keyboard. Despite the existence of different visual programming languages, like Blender, there are no programs in which well known programming languages like Java, Haskell or C(++) can be visually implemented. 

In this project we have (attempted) to make an application in which the programming language Haskell can be visually implemented.

In this report the different aspects of the developing process are being discussed. The upcoming chapters discuss the requirements analysis, the design process, the implementation process (front end \& back end), how the application has been tested, the evaluation of the process and the conclusions.
